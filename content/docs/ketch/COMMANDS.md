# Commands

Every ketch command in one place: what it does, the form it takes, and one
working example. `PKG` below is an installed name, an alias, or
`owner/repo` — most commands that take one also accept `@version` on the end
(`sharkdp/fd@v10.2.0`). Global flags work everywhere: `--root <DIR>` points at
a different ketch tree, `-v/--verbose` shows what ketch is doing, `-q/--quiet`
prints only errors and requested data, `--no-color` disables colour, and
`--no-emoji` drops the icons in front of status lines.

**Icons.** On a terminal, each status line starts with an icon for what it
reports: 📦 install, ⏫ upgrade or update, 🧹 uninstall or remove, ⏬ download,
🔗 link, ⏪ rollback, 🔍 search, 🩺 doctor, and otherwise ✅ success, ❗ warning,
❌ error, 💡 note. They are on by default (`emoji` in `config.toml`,
`KETCH_EMOJI`) and never appear in a pipe or a file, under `TERM=dumb`, in
`--json` or `--names-only` output, in table data, or in the log.

## Install and remove

### `ketch install [PKG]... [options]`

Install one or more packages. Inference picks the release asset matching the
host (architecture, OS, libc); a manifest or `--asset` says what to do instead.

```bash
ketch install BurntSushi/ripgrep  # any repo that publishes releases
ketch install rg                  # or a name the registry knows
ketch install sharkdp/fd@v10.2.0  # or an exact version
ketch install --path ./mytool     # a local binary, archive, symlink, or .app
```

A package that is already installed is not updated behind your back. With a
newer release, `install` asks `<pkg> <installed> is installed; update to
<latest>?` (default no) and, on yes, updates it the way `ketch upgrade` does;
`--yes` answers yes, and without a terminal it stops with exit 5 and says to
pass `--yes` or run `ketch upgrade`. With nothing newer it fails with exit 5:
`cannot install <pkg>: <version> is already installed and no update is
available` (`--force` reinstalls). An exact version (`pkg@1.2.0`) and a pinned
package behave as before.

Options: `--path <PATH>` installs a local file (equivalent to
`local:<PATH>`); `--name <NAME>` sets the installed name for a single
package; `--force/-f` reinstalls the requested version even when present;
`--pre` considers prereleases; `--no-link` unpacks without linking onto PATH;
`--require-checksum` refuses releases with no published checksum;
`--asset <NAME>` takes one release file by exact name (asks for confirmation,
since the platform check is skipped); `-j/--jobs <N>` and `-y/--yes` control
parallelism and prompts. Aliased as `ketch i`.

When a release ships several binaries sharing the package's name and no
manifest names one, only one of them is linked: the one `--bin <NAME>` names;
failing that, the binary named exactly like the package; failing that, a choice
remembered from last time (in `state.json`, or during `ketch sync` in
`ketch.lock`), or a numbered pick in a terminal. Binaries with other names are
linked as usual. With `--yes` or without a terminal there is no pick, and the
install fails with the candidates listed — see the `bin` section of
[MANIFESTS.md](MANIFESTS.md).

`--bin <NAME>` (single package) answers that question up front, so it works
without a terminal: `ketch install owner/rtok --bin rtok-cli`. It is stored in
`state.json` like a pick and reused on later upgrades. It fails when no binary in
the release has that name, and when the package's manifest already has a `bin`
(change that instead).

### `ketch uninstall <NAME>...`

Remove installed packages. Names resolve like `install` (installed name,
binary, or `owner/repo`); a typo stops the command before anything is removed.
The package's whole store folder goes, including anything an interrupted
update left in it.
A name that is not installed prints `<name>: not found` and exits 4; every
missing name is listed and nothing is removed.

```bash
ketch uninstall rg
ketch uninstall fd ripgrep --yes  # skip the confirmation
```

Aliased as `ketch remove` and `ketch rm`.

### `ketch upgrade [NAME]...`

Upgrade installed packages to their latest release. Empty means every
unpinned package. Shows a `from -> to` table, asks, then installs.

Each version is unpacked into a fresh folder of its own, so nothing the old
version shipped can linger in the new one, and a leftover from an interrupted
upgrade is removed first — or the upgrade stops, naming it. The previous
version's folder is kept beside it for `ketch rollback` until `ketch prune`.

```bash
ketch upgrade              # everything unpinned
ketch upgrade ripgrep fd   # just these
ketch upgrade --dry-run    # show the plan, change nothing
```

Options: `--pre` considers prereleases; `--force` upgrades pinned packages
too; `--bin <NAME>` (exactly one package) picks which binary to link when the
new release ships several sharing the package's name, as on `install`;
`-j/--jobs <N>`, `-y/--yes`. Pinned and `local:` packages are skipped unless
forced.

### `ketch rollback <PKG> [--to <VERSION>]`

Switch a package back to a version still on disk. Without `--to`, restores the
previous retained version.

```bash
ketch rollback ripgrep
ketch rollback rg --to 14.1.0
```

### `ketch prune [NAME]... [--keep <N>]`

Remove retained old versions according to the retention policy. Empty means
every installed package. `--keep <N>` updates the stored policy.

```bash
ketch prune
ketch prune ripgrep --keep 2
```

### `ketch pin <NAME>...` / `ketch unpin <NAME>...`

Hold a package at its current version (`pin`), or release the hold (`unpin`).
Pinned packages are skipped by `upgrade` unless `--force` is passed.

```bash
ketch pin ripgrep
ketch upgrade --force        # upgrades pinned packages too
ketch unpin ripgrep
```

### `ketch link <NAME>...` / `ketch unlink <NAME>...`

Re-create (`link`) or remove (`unlink`) the bin-dir links for an installed
package. `unlink` keeps the payload installed; `upgrade` preserves the linked
state.

```bash
ketch unlink ripgrep   # keep it, take it off PATH
ketch link ripgrep     # put it back
```
### `ketch import winget|brew|linux <NAME> [--dry-run] [--yes]`

Add a package another package manager already knows. ketch reads that
manager's definition, converts it to a user manifest in
`~/.ketch/manifests/<name>.toml`, and installs it the normal way, with the
asset and checksum the definition names.

```bash
ketch import brew codex                    # a Homebrew cask (or formula)
ketch import brew fly --cask               # only look for a cask; --formula for a formula
ketch import winget BurntSushi.ripgrep.MSVC  # a winget id, case-sensitive
ketch import linux lazygit                 # Arch Linux, then the AUR
ketch import linux obsidian --dry-run      # print the manifest, change nothing
```

| Source | Where the definition comes from |
| --- | --- |
| `winget` | the installer manifest of the newest version in [winget-pkgs](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs) |
| `brew` | the cask or formula JSON from [formulae.brew.sh](https://formulae.brew.sh/docs/api/) |
| `linux` | the `.SRCINFO` of the [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/packages/) package, or of the AUR's `-bin`/`-appimage` package when Arch builds it from source |

Only a package whose downloads are GitHub release assets
(`https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/releases/download/...`) converts. A
download from anywhere else — a vendor's CDN, SourceForge, a source tarball,
a GitHub homepage with downloads hosted elsewhere, or a mix — writes
nothing and exits 1 with
`<name> can't be converted: it is not distributed through GitHub Releases, and that is not supported yet.`
So do installers ketch cannot run (`.msi`, `.msix`, Inno or NSIS `.exe`,
`.deb`, `.rpm`), cask artifacts beyond an app or binaries (`pkg`,
`installer`), and two files for one platform.

The manifest holds only what ketch needs: `name`, `source`, `kind` for an
app, `bin`, and one `[asset.target]` pattern per platform, with the version
replaced by `*` so it keeps matching. It starts with a
``# Written by `ketch import …` `` line; a file of that name without it is
yours, and import refuses to replace it.

Running it again is safe: when the converted manifest and the installed
version are already what the source says, it prints
`Everything is up to date` and does nothing. A new version upstream rewrites
the file and upgrades; a changed manifest at the same version reinstalls.

The catalogue addresses can be pointed elsewhere (a mirror, or a test
double) with `KETCH_IMPORT_BREW`, `KETCH_IMPORT_WINGET_API`,
`KETCH_IMPORT_WINGET_RAW`, `KETCH_IMPORT_ARCH`, `KETCH_IMPORT_ARCH_GITLAB` and
`KETCH_IMPORT_AUR`. The winget listing goes through the GitHub API, so it uses
your GitHub token when one is set.

## Inspect

### `ketch list`

`ketch list [local|remote] [--json] [--names-only]`, aliased as `ketch ls`.

Show what is installed, what the registry offers, or both in one table with
the newest version of each.

| Command | Shows | Network |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ketch list local` | Installed packages, from the install record | Never |
| `ketch list remote` | Packages the registry offers, with their latest version | Needed; fails without it |
| `ketch list` | Both, one row per package, sorted by name | Used for `latest`; without it, the local part |

"The registry" here is the local copy `ketch update` fetches, plus your own
manifests in `~/.ketch/manifests` (yours win when a name is in both). The few
packages compiled into ketch as a fallback are not listed; run `ketch update`
to see the registry they come from.

**Columns.**

- `package` — the name to install, upgrade or uninstall it by.
- `installed` — the installed version. `(pinned)` means `ketch pin` holds it;
  `(+N retained)` means N earlier versions are kept for `ketch rollback`.
  Empty for a package that is not installed.
- `latest` — the newest release of the package's source. `(update available)`
  follows it when that is an update for the installed version. `?` means the
  source did not answer. Empty for a package installed from a local path,
  which has no upstream to ask.
- `source` — where the package comes from. For an installed package, that is
  where it was installed from, and where its next version will come from.
- `description` (`remote` only) — the registry's one-line summary, cut to the
  terminal width (`COLUMNS` sets another width; nothing is cut when the output
  is piped).

**Markers.** In `ketch list`, an installed package has `*` in the first column.
On a colour terminal the marker is `●`, the name is bold, and
`(update available)` is yellow. `CLICOLOR_FORCE=1` asks for colour even into a
pipe; `--no-color` and `NO_COLOR` turn it off.

**Update available** is decided the way `ketch outdated` decides it. `latest` is
the newest release the package's source reports, from the same lookup
`ketch outdated` makes: stable releases only, unless `prerelease = true` is set
in `config.toml` or in the package's manifest. That version is compared with
the installed one, and only a strictly newer version counts; a release with
the installed tag never does. A pinned package is never offered an update.

**Pinned packages** are listed with both versions and `(pinned)`, get no
`(update available)`, and are left out of the footer. `ketch unpin` lets them
move again.

**Packages from outside the registry** — installed from `owner/repo` or
another `scheme:id` reference — are listed too, and their `latest` comes from
their own source. One installed from a local path (`ketch install --path`) is
listed with an empty `latest`.

Under the table, `N updates available: ketch upgrade <names>` names every
package with an update, as the command that takes them all.

**Offline, and packages that do not answer.** Latest versions are looked up in
parallel (`jobs` at a time, 4 by default), with a counter on stderr while they
load. A source that fails — rate-limited, gone, unreachable — shows `?` in
`latest`, and one line under the table names each such package; every other row
is still printed and the command still succeeds. When no source answers at all,
the network is taken to be missing: `ketch list` prints the `ketch list local`
table followed by `latest: offline` and exits 0, while `ketch list remote`,
which has nothing to show without it, exits non-zero.

Answers are cached for 10 minutes in `~/.ketch/cache/latest.json`, per source
and per prerelease setting, so listing twice in a row asks GitHub once. Only
answers are cached, never failures. Delete the file to ask again sooner;
`ketch outdated` and `ketch upgrade` never read it.

**`--json`** prints, for each mode:

- `local` — an array of `{"name", "installed", "pinned", "retained", "source"}`,
  with `retained` the list of versions kept for rollback.
- `remote` — an array of `{"name", "latest", "description", "source"}`, with
  `latest` `null` for a source that did not answer.
- no mode — `{"packages": [...], "unreachable": [...]}`. Each package is
  `{"name", "installed", "latest", "update_available", "pinned", "source"}`;
  `installed` is `null` when it is not installed and `latest` is `null` when
  it is unknown. `unreachable` names the packages whose `latest` is unknown.
  Offline, `packages` holds only installed packages.

**`--names-only`** prints the names alone, one per line, for each mode; it never
touches the network.

**Changed in 0.7.** `ketch list` used to show installed packages only, and its
`--json` was an array of install records; it now shows everything, in the
shape above. Scripts that want the installed packages should call
`ketch list local`. `ketch list --installed` is a hidden alias of
`ketch list local`, kept for one release.

ketch list local --json      # installed packages, for scripts
ketch list --names-only      # every package name, one per line
ketch list remote --json     # the registry with latest versions
```

### `ketch outdated [--json] [--pre]`

Show installed packages that have a newer release. A source that cannot be
reached is a warning, not a failure — unless nothing could be checked at all.

```bash
ketch outdated
ketch outdated --json   # {"status","outdated","failed","unreachable"}
```

### `ketch info <PKG> [--assets] [--json]`

Show details about a package, installed or not: source, description, latest
and installed versions, links, retention, verification.

```bash
ketch info BurntSushi/ripgrep
ketch info rg --assets   # every release asset with its score and why
```

Aliased as `ketch show`.

### `ketch why <PKG> [--json]`

Explain how a package would be resolved, without installing it: which manifest
tier answered, which release and asset were picked, and why.

```bash
ketch why sharkdp/fd@v10.2.0
ketch why rg --json
```

### `ketch changelog <PKG> [--latest] [--file] [--release]`

Show what changed: the changelog file the package ships, or the release notes
published with the release. Prefers the file on disk for the installed
version; falls back to the notes.

```bash
ketch changelog ripgrep            # installed version
ketch changelog ripgrep --latest   # newest release instead
ketch changelog ripgrep --file     # only the shipped file
ketch changelog ripgrep --release  # only the published notes
```

### `ketch search <QUERY>... [-n <LIMIT>]`

Search GitHub (and searching plugins) for installable repositories.

```bash
ketch search fuzzy finder
ketch search ripgrep -n 5
```

## Reproduce

### `ketch lock [--file <FILE>] [--check]`

Write `./ketch.lock` from what is installed — the reproducible record of the
machine's tools, pinned to exact releases. See [LOCKFILE.md](LOCKFILE.md).

```bash
ketch lock              # write ./ketch.lock
ketch lock --check      # has the tree drifted from it?
ketch lock -f tools.lock
```

### `ketch sync [--file <FILE>] [--prune] [--dry-run]`

Install everything `ketch.lock` names, at the versions it names. A package the
lockfile does not mention is left alone unless `--prune` is passed (which asks
first, since it can lose work).

```bash
ketch sync                 # missing or drifted packages only
ketch sync --dry-run       # show the +/~/− plan, change nothing
ketch sync --prune --yes   # also remove extras, without asking
```

## History

### `ketch history [PKG] [-n <LIMIT>] [--json]`

Show what was installed, upgraded and removed, newest first. Omit the package
for the whole tree in one timeline.

```bash
ketch history
ketch history ripgrep -n 10
```

### `ketch stats [--json]`

Summarise everything ketch has recorded in `stats.db`.

```bash
ketch stats
ketch stats --json
```

## Registry and sources

### `ketch update`

Refresh the package registry into `~/.ketch/registry`. (For installed
packages, see `upgrade`.)

```bash
ketch update
```

Runs automatically at the start of `install` and `upgrade` unless
`auto_update` is `false` in `~/.ketch/config.toml`
(`KETCH_AUTO_UPDATE=false`).

### `ketch registry validate [DIR] [--fixture <DIR>] [--changed <NAME>] [--json]`

Validate a registry tree the way the pre-push hook does: every `ketch.toml` parsed and
checked, plus name collisions. `--fixture` offline-installs entries against
local files as extra proof.

```bash
ketch registry validate
ketch registry validate ./ketch-registry --fixture ./fixtures
```

### `ketch registry status [--json]`

Show the local registry copy's age and source, without fetching.

```bash
ketch registry status
```

### `ketch registry push [--file <FILE>] [--registry <REPO>] [--dry-run] [--yes]`

Compare this project's `ketch.toml` with the registry's copy and open a pull
request with it. Opens straight away for a new package; shows a diff and asks
for an update; reports `unchanged` and opens nothing when identical. See
[REGISTRY.md](REGISTRY.md).

```bash
KETCH_GITHUB_TOKEN=... ketch registry push
ketch registry push --dry-run
```

### `ketch plugin list [--json]` / `ketch plugin dir`

Show discovered source plugins (`ketch-source-<scheme>` in `~/.ketch/plugins`
and on `PATH`), or print the plugins directory. See [PLUGINS.md](PLUGINS.md).

```bash
ketch plugin list
ketch plugin dir
```

## Environment

### `ketch doctor [--fix] [--json]`

Check the environment and the install tree: version, PATH setup, platform
checks, log, registry age, store against `state.json`. Exits non-zero when a
check fails. On Windows it also warns about user PATH entries that name a ketch
bin dir whose folder is gone — this root's, or any `.ketch\bin`.

```bash
ketch doctor
ketch doctor --fix    # repair what can be repaired (the PATH setup)
```

### `ketch path [install|uninstall|status]`

Put the ketch bin directory on PATH. Bare `ketch path` shows the status
table; that is the default subcommand.

```bash
ketch path                  # bin dir, PATH state, per-shell table
ketch path install          # edit shell startup files (asks per shell)
ketch path install --print  # print the line to add by hand
ketch path install --all    # act on every known shell
ketch path uninstall        # take the block back out again
```

### `ketch config create [--file <FILE>] [--force] [--yes]`

Write a package config (`ketch.toml`) by answering questions — source, name,
bin entries, asset patterns — then preview and write the file. A package that
links binaries must name the command it puts on PATH, so the first `bin` entry
is asked for rather than offered; its name defaults to the package name.
Answers can be piped on stdin, one per line. See [MANIFESTS.md](MANIFESTS.md).

```bash
ketch config create
ketch config create --file ./ketch.toml --yes
```

### `ketch config reset [--yes]`

Write `config.toml` in the ketch root with the compiled defaults. Asks first
unless `--yes`; backs the existing file up beside itself as
`config.toml.bak-<unix-seconds>` unless it is missing or already matches a
sibling backup.

```bash
ketch config reset
ketch config reset --yes
```

### `ketch completions <SHELL> [--install]`

Print a shell completion script, or install it into the shell's user
completion directory with `--install`.

```bash
ketch completions zsh > _ketch
ketch completions bash --install
```

The bash and PowerShell scripts also complete package names: installed ones after
`uninstall`, `upgrade`, `pin`, `unpin`, `link`, `unlink`, `info`, `why`,
`changelog` and `rollback`, and names from the local registry copy after
`install` and `search`. It asks the binary for them with the internal
`ketch __complete <installed|registry> [PREFIX]`, which reads the state file and
the registry already on disk and never touches the network. A `--root` earlier
on the command line is honoured.

`--install` writes the bash script to
`${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/bash-completion/completions/ketch`, where
bash-completion 2 loads it on first use. On macOS that needs more than the
system shell: `/bin/bash` is 3.2 and bash-completion 2 wants bash 4.2 or newer.
Install a current bash and bash-completion 2 (with Homebrew:
`brew install bash bash-completion@2`), make that bash your login shell, and
source bash-completion's `bash_completion` from `~/.bashrc` as its caveats
say. The script itself also runs under bash
3.2, so `eval "$(ketch completions bash)"` in `~/.bashrc` works without either.

On Windows, `--install` (and `ketch self install`, which installs every
shell's script) also switches completion on, since neither shell loads a
completion directory by itself:

- **PowerShell.** The script goes to `Documents\PowerShell\Completions\ketch.ps1`,
  and a block between `# >>> ketch >>>` and `# <<< ketch <<<` in the
  CurrentUserAllHosts profile of PowerShell 7 (`Documents\PowerShell\profile.ps1`)
  and Windows PowerShell 5.1 (`Documents\WindowsPowerShell\profile.ps1`)
  dot-sources it. Documents is the folder PowerShell reports, so a OneDrive
  redirect is followed. A profile that does not exist yet is created only when
  that edition is installed and its execution policy runs local scripts;
  otherwise ketch says why it left it alone.
- **cmd.** cmd has no programmable completion, so it gets doskey macros:
  `ki` (`ketch install`), `ku` (`ketch upgrade`), `kl` (`ketch list`) and `kun`
  (`ketch uninstall`), each passing its arguments on. They live in
  `<root>\share\ketch\ketch.doskey`, loaded by
  `doskey /macrofile="…"` appended to
  `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor\AutoRun` with ` & ` after
  whatever AutoRun already runs.

`ketch self uninstall` takes the profile blocks out (deleting a profile that
held nothing else) and removes exactly its own command from AutoRun, leaving
the earlier value as it was, or deleting the value when it held only ketch's.

## ketch itself

### `ketch self install [--force] [--link-dir <DIR>]`

Install this release of ketch as a package, into the store and bin dir. What
the curl/PowerShell/Homebrew installers run.

```bash
ketch self install
```

### `ketch self upgrade [--dry-run] [--force] [--yes]`

Upgrade ketch to the latest release. Aliased as `ketch self update`. A ketch
installed with mise and never `self install`ed is mise's to upgrade: this
refuses, and names `mise upgrade`.

```bash
ketch self upgrade
ketch self upgrade --dry-run
```

### `ketch self version`

Print the running version and where it lives (target, root, binary, PATH).

```bash
ketch self version
```

### `ketch self uninstall [--keep-packages] [--dry-run] [--yes]`

Remove ketch and everything it installed, permanently. Lists what it is about
to delete and asks first. `--keep-packages` removes only ketch. A ketch
installed with mise also asks whether to run `mise unuse -g` for its own copy;
`--yes` answers that too.
On Windows the running `ketch.exe` cannot delete itself, so the rest of the
root is removed by a background process once ketch has exited.

On Windows it also removes what ketch wrote to the registry. Today that is
only the bin dir in the user PATH (`HKCU\Environment\Path`), written by
`install.ps1` or `ketch path install`. The entry is matched however it is
spelled: case, quotes, `/` or `\`, a trailing separator, or an 8.3 short
name. `--keep-packages` leaves it, as it leaves the shell blocks, because the
packages still in the bin dir need it. ketch never registers itself in Apps &
Features, so there is no entry there to remove.

It also removes the PowerShell profile blocks and the cmd AutoRun addition
that switch completion on — those with `--keep-packages` too, since both
load ketch itself.

```bash
ketch self uninstall --dry-run
ketch self uninstall --keep-packages
```
