# Content contract — `content/projects/<slug>.md` and `content/docs/<slug>/`

Each product in the catalog (home grid, Products menu, footer, pricing) and its showcase page is generated from one Markdown file in `content/projects/`. The files are
**synced** from each project's `docs/site.md` (see `content/projects/README.md`): do not edit them here.

The file name is the slug and the URL: `content/projects/rtok.md` → `<base>rtok/` (base defaults to `/landing/`, override with `SITE_BASE`)
(route `src/pages/[slug].astro`). The schema lives in `src/content.config.ts`; `npm run build` fails on a
violation. `content/projects/README.md` is excluded from the collection.

## Frontmatter

| Field | Required | Type | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `title` | yes | string | Project name as the repository spells it |
| `tagline` | yes | string, ≤ 160 chars | One-sentence pitch |
| `repo` | yes | URL | Starts with `https://github.com/` |
| `homepage` | no | URL | The project's own documentation site (renders a “Documentation” button) |
| `install` | yes | string | Primary install command, one line (hero install block with copy button) |
| `install_alternatives` | no | list of strings | Other install commands, README order (the home card prefers a `ketch install …` one) |
| `version` | yes | semver, no `v` | Latest published release |
| `status` | no | string, ≤ 48 chars | Release status shown instead of the `v<version>` badge (e.g. `In development · no release yet` while a tag has no published release) |
| `accent` | yes | `#RRGGBB` | Dark-theme accent of the project's own site → page `--accent` |
| `accent2` | no | `#RRGGBB` | Second accent (e.g. rtok coral `#FF6B4A`) → page `--accent-2` |
| `accentLight` | no | `#RRGGBB` | Darker accent for light surfaces (e.g. cox `#3D8B3A`, ketch `#0F6F5C`) → `--accent-light` |
| `pro_price` | no | string, ≤ 24 chars | Pro price label override (**placeholder**; default from `PRO` in `src/lib/site.ts`) |
| `featured` | no | boolean | Show this product in the home “Featured tool” slot (first `true` wins, else the first by `order`) |
| `order` | no | integer | Catalog order (ascending; ties by title) |

When `accent2` / `accentLight` are missing, the page falls back to the theme table in `src/lib/site.ts`.

## Body

An HTML comment naming the source, then these H2 sections, in this order:

1. `## Overview` — one or two paragraphs, including any status caveat. Rendered as prose.
2. `## Features` — bullets `- **Name.** Description.` → one glass card per bullet.
3. `## Install` — primary command first, then alternatives in fenced blocks → each block gets a copy button.
4. `## Usage examples` (or `## Usage`) — a paragraph caption followed by a fenced block, repeated → usage cards.
5. `## Links` — `- Label: <https://…>` bullets → link tiles.

## Adding a product

1. Add `content/projects/<slug>.md` following this contract. The catalog, Products menu, footer and pricing
   pick it up automatically; the showcase terminal is built from its `## Usage examples` code blocks.
2. Optional polish: a scripted terminal in `DEMOS` / a flow in `FLOWS` (`src/data/showcase.ts`), a theme in
   `THEMES`, Pro placeholder copy in `PRO` and free highlights in `FREE_HIGHLIGHTS` (`src/lib/site.ts`), and
   art in `public/images/<slug>/` (`hero-*`, `prop-*`, `og.jpg`; see `art/`).

## Docs — `content/docs/<slug>/**/*.md`

The product's docs section is generated from a copy of its repository's `docs/` folder (every
user-facing `*.md` except `docs/site.md`; internal pages such as plans, research, audits, design
notes and maintainer runbooks are left out by the workflow's rsync filter), synced by the same
workflow as the showcase file. The showcase page keeps its README-derived text; the docs pages
are separate:

| Page | URL | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Docs overview | `<base><slug>/docs/` | `src/data/docs-overview.ts` (copy restating the product's docs/README) + the doc list |
| One page per doc | `<base><slug>/docs/<file-slug>/` | `content/docs/<slug>/<file>.md`, e.g. `design/loop.md` → `design-loop` |
| Site-authored page | `<base><slug>/docs/<page>/` | a `page` entry in `src/data/docs-nav.json` + a component (ketch: `getting-started`) |

Rules for a doc file (the upstream docs already follow them):

- One `# H1` — the page title. `##` / `###` headings become the on-page TOC; their ids match
  GitHub's anchors, so `other.md#some-heading` links keep working.
- Relative links to another synced doc become site links; any other relative link (source files,
  excluded docs, folders, images) points to GitHub at the synced commit (`_source.json`).
- Fenced code blocks follow CommonMark: a fence closes only with a bare fence line, so an unclosed
  fence swallows the headings after it — on GitHub and here alike.
- `> [!NOTE]`, `> [!TIP]`, `> [!IMPORTANT]`, `> [!WARNING]`, `> [!CAUTION]` render as callouts.

`src/data/docs-nav.json` sets tab order, short titles, groups and the files that get no page
(`exclude`, with a reason — e.g. maintainer runbooks, scope proposals). A synced file that is in
neither list still gets a page under "More". `npm run check:docs` (run in CI after the build)
fails when a synced file has neither a page nor an exclusion, when a page's heading count differs
from its source, or when any internal link or `#fragment` does not resolve under the base.

## Site rules

- **License:** the page ignores the `License:` bullet in `## Links` and renders one shared license block for
  every project: GNU GPLv3, a royalty-free license (proprietary desktop, mobile and web apps with
  attribution), or a commercial license — at your choice (`LICENSE` in `src/lib/site.ts`).
- **README caveats** the synced copy lacks are kept in `CAVEATS` in `src/lib/site.ts` (e.g. rtok: no live
  A/B cost reduction has been established yet).
- **Pro tiers are placeholders:** every Pro price and Pro feature is labelled “Placeholder” on the site.
- Facts come only from the project's own README / docs / site copy. Never invent features, stars, download
  counts, benchmarks or testimonials.
- English only; inline code for commands, flags and paths.
