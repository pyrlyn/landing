# cox tools

Every tool implements one contract (`Tool::spec` / `subject` / `call`):
untruncated output goes to the archive first, the model sees the capped
visible form plus an `expand` pointer. Permission rules match on
`subject()` (path, command line, URL, or namespaced MCP name); `bash`
also hands over `segments()`, the simple commands of its line, so a
`Bash(prefix:*)` rule must cover each one (see how-it-works.md, Example 3).

Core tools are always in context; deferred tools join through `tool_search`
(D6d). `agent` is never available to itself.

| Tool | Risk | Deferred | Subject | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `read` | ReadOnly | no | path | whole / `lines="a-b"` / `mode="outline"`; images returned as images, other binaries refused |
| `grep` | ReadOnly | no | pattern | ripgrep libs, respects `.gitignore` |
| `glob` | ReadOnly | no | pattern | mtime order, fuzzy with `query` |
| `edit` | Write | no | path | exact `str_replace`, ambiguity errors |
| `apply_patch` | Write (Destructive past 5 deleted files) | no | patch summary | Codex V4A grammar |
| `write` | Write | no | path | new files; rewrites over 200 lines refused |
| `bash` | Exec (Destructive as classified) | no | command line | sandboxed, streamed, `background: true` archives |
| `todo` | ReadOnly | no | — | drives the TUI todo panel |
| `expand` | ReadOnly | no | archive id | reads back archived output, capped |
| `ask_user` | ReadOnly | yes | question | blocks the turn; `--answer` headless; TUI: modal |
| `tool_search` | ReadOnly | no | query | reveals up to 5 deferred schemas |
| `web_fetch` | ReadOnly | yes | URL | readability fallback; domain rules apply |
| `agent` | max of its tools; Destructive with `isolation: "worktree"` | yes | preset | `explore` / `shell` presets, own budget; worktree isolation asks (denied in plan) |
| `memory_save` | Write | yes | name | one fact file + index + FTS row |
| `memory_search` | ReadOnly | yes | query | FTS first, then files; top 5 capped |
| `diagnostics` | ReadOnly (Exec for the call that starts a server) | yes | path | one sandboxed LSP server per language; falls back to `bash` |
| `mcp__<server>__<tool>` | from server annotations (default Write) | yes | namespaced name | fail-open servers |

## MCP elicitation

An MCP server may ask the person for input during a tool call
(`elicitation/create`, or a 2026-07-28 `input_required` round). cox answers
only where a person can:

- TUI and `--plain`: the client declares `elicitation.form`. Each field of
  the requested form is one question in the question modal, labelled
  `mcp:<server> asks:` (in `--plain`, `question from mcp:<server>:`), with
  enum labels, `yes`/`no` or free text; a bad answer is asked again with
  the reason. A review step names the fields to send and offers `send`,
  `edit` (ask again; Enter keeps the last answer) or `decline`. Questions
  are events and land in the rollout, so neither the review nor an `edit`
  round repeats what was typed. Esc (in `--plain`, an empty line)
  cancels the whole request. While a question is open the call's
  `mcp.timeout_s` does not count.
- URL mode (TUI and `--plain`, `elicitation.url`): one question shows the
  message, the URL as it will be opened (normalized, so a non-ASCII host
  appears as punycode), its host, and a warning for a punycode host or a
  plain `http` URL; it offers `open` or `decline`. The browser opens only
  on `open`, and the server gets `accept`; the flow's outcome itself stays
  between the browser and the server. A URL that is not `http(s)`, names no
  host or would not survive the opener unchanged is declined without
  asking.
- `cox run -p` declares no elicitation capability and never asks; a
  server that elicits anyway gets `decline`. `--answer` does not apply.
- `cox acp` connects no MCP servers today, so there is nothing to answer.

Answers go to the server only: never into the transcript, the rollout or
the model's context. The server's text is shown sanitized, like any tool
output.

Edits are diff-shaped (`edit`, `apply_patch`); `write` is for new files.
Every path from the model passes `path::confine`; every shell command runs
under the platform sandbox unless the session chose `danger-full-access`.

`read` returns a PNG, JPEG, GIF or WebP file (sniffed by its magic bytes,
not its extension) as an image: a one-line `media type, size` text plus the
image itself, which `lines` and `mode` do not apply to. One image is capped
at 3,750,000 bytes (5,000,000 once base64-encoded, the smallest per-image
limit a supported provider documents); a larger one is refused as
`too_large`. These are the four formats Anthropic and OpenAI both accept.

`diagnostics` (P41) returns one file's diagnostics from a language server as
`path:line:col: severity: message [source code]` lines, most severe first,
then a summary such as `3 errors, 1 warning`. `path` is confined like any
other; `wait_ms` bounds the wait, capped by `lsp.timeout_s`. The first call
for a language starts its server, which runs the project's build scripts and
proc macros, so that call is `Exec` and the permission engine asks; once the
server runs, calls are `ReadOnly`. Servers are spawned under the same sandbox
wrap as stdio MCP servers (bare under `danger-full-access`; refused on a
Landlock-only host or one with no sandbox backend) with the child env
allowlist, one per language per session, and killed when the session ends.
A server that dies is restarted once per call. Pushed diagnostics count as
complete after `lsp.quiet_ms` with no newer push and no `$/progress` work
open; a server that advertises `diagnosticProvider` is asked instead. A
deadline returns what arrived with a note, not an error.

With `lsp.after_edit = true` (off by default, T59.3), `edit` and `write` end
their result with the diagnostics the change introduced: only when the file's
server already runs (an edit never starts one), keyed by start line, code and
message against the server's last report for the file, errors first, at most
ten lines, waiting at most `lsp.after_edit_ms`. A dead or slow server adds
nothing, and neither does a report the server had not settled by the
deadline; the server's text passes through `sanitize` first. ACP's
client-backed `edit` and `write` are left alone: they write the editor's
buffer, not the file the server reads.

The default servers (`[lsp.servers]`, see config.md):

| Name | Program | Extensions |
|---|---|---|
| `rust` | `rust-analyzer` | `rs` |
| `typescript` | `typescript-language-server --stdio` | `ts` `tsx` `js` `jsx` |
| `python` | `pyright-langserver --stdio` | `py` |
| `go` | `gopls` | `go` |

Only the user config chooses them: a project `.cox/config.toml` that sets
`lsp.servers` is ignored with a warning, because a repository must not pick a
program cox runs. With no server for a file's extension, its program missing
from PATH, or no sandbox to run it in, the tool answers with an error that
tells the model to run the project's checker with `bash` instead
(`cargo check`, `tsc --noEmit`, ...). `cox doctor` lists each server's
program as found or missing.
